## Quick Start

**NOTE**:
    The Docker command provided in this quick start is an example, and parameters
    should be adjusted to suit your needs.

Launch the JDownloader 2 docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=jdownloader-2 \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/jdownloader-2:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user/Downloads:/output:rw \
    koelle/jdownloader-2
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/jdownloader-2`: Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency.
  - `/home/user/Downloads`: This is where downloaded files are stored.

Access the JDownloader 2 GUI by browsing to `http://your-host-ip:5800`.
