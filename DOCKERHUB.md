## Quick Start

**NOTE**:
    The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
    and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the JDownloader 2 docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=jdownloader-2 \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/jdownloader-2:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user/Downloads:/output:rw \
    koelle/jdownloader-2
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/jdownloader-2`: This is where the application stores its configuration, states, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `/home/user/Downloads`: This is where downloaded files are stored.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the JDownloader 2 GUI.
