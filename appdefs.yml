          [MyJDownloader](https://my.jdownloader.org) is an online service providing
          remote access to your JDownloader with Web Interface, Android App, iPhone App,
          Windows Phone App and Browser Extensions.  It allows to check download status,
          add links and solve captchas from everywhere.

          To activate, open the JDownloader UI and click the *My.JDownloader* tab.
      - title: Direct Connection
        level: 3
        content: |-
          When using MyJDownloader from a device on the same local network as the
          JDownloader Docker container instance, *Direct Connection* mode can be enabled
          to reduce the latency and increase the bandwidth.  With this mode, instead of
          going through the cloud, the communication is done through a direct connection
          between the device and JDownloader.

          The default container's network being in *bridge* mode, the *Direct Connection*
          mode is not automatically detected/activated and the following steps are required:

            * Make sure the container's port `3129` is mapped to the host port `3129`.
              This is done by adding the parameter `-p 3129:3129` to the `docker run`
              command.
            * Open the JDownloader UI.
            * Go to *Settings*->*Advanced Settings*.
            * Search for `MyJDownloaderSettings`.
            * Set `Custom Device IPs` to the IP address of the host running the container,
              using double quotes and brackets like this example: `["192.168.1.1"]`.
            * Change the `Direct Connection Mode` to `Allow lan/wan connections with
              manual port forwarding`.
            * Restart JDownloader (*File*->*Restart*).

          The easiest way to use the [Click'n'Load] feature is by installing the
          [MyJDownloader browser extension].  With this method, the browser extension
          handles POST requests to `http://127.0.0.1:9666` and forward the links to
          JDownloader via the *MyJDownloader* service.

        Port used by *MyJDownloader* mobile applications and browser extensions to
        establish a direct connect to the JDownloader Docker container instance.
        Port needs to be exposed only if *MyJDownloader* is enabled and configured in
        *Direct Connection* mode.  **NOTE**: Since this port is being reported to the
        *MyJDownloader* online service, the port mapped on the host side **must** be
        the same (i.e. 3129).
